# What is Code & Coffee?  
🧑‍🤝‍🧑🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **We’re a Community**. Our attendees feel like they’re a part of the group. This group is not run by a company -- it is ran by a group of individual community members.  
📈🔍 **Of developers**. Or for people who work with them or want to become one.  
🐣🐓 **At Any Level**. Whether you’re aspiring, newer, or more experienced.  

We invite anyone working on software development, especially new devs and folks that work with them. You may already be working in one of these roles, or you might be interested in learning more about these roles — either way, you’re welcome!

**What do we do at these events?**  
💬 **Discussion**. Many attendees come with questions, ideas, or strategies to discuss.  
🕸️ **Networking**. Many people come to meet people, that's enough reason on its own.  
🫲🏻 **Support**. Many of our attendees in the past have also found mentors, mentees, and peer-support. We encourage it!  

Many people come with questions, ideas or strategies to discuss — and many others just come to meet people! Many of our attendees in the past have also found mentors, mentees, and peer-support friends — and we encourage attendees to form relationships like these.
## Identity & Boundaries
If this sounds like you, you belong here:
>I am an aspiring developer, a professional developer, a hobbyist with a side project, a self-taught hobbyist in coding, trying to learn development, and/or someone that types code into a text editor. I am looking to meet new people that share a similar interest to me and to grow alongside them.

People such as designers, PMs, and dev-adjacent technical current/past individual contributors(DevRel, solutions/sales engineers, EMs, DevRels) are folks we'd love to have within our community. We welcome unique perspectives into our community.

**You are ENCOURAGED to share any jobs you(or your company) may be offering**. For the safety of community members, we ask that 3rd-party recruiters interested in sourcing on behalf of another company reach out to an organizer beforehand. We prefer not to have unwarranted solicitation.
  
## Rituals
- At every event, we have an intro circle at either 15mins or 30mins after doors open.

## Locations - When / Where we Gather
- **In-person**: Every 2 weeks we gather at a venue officially posted on the [Meetup group page](https://codeandcoffee.org/#footer) for your local city. 
- **Online**: 24/7, we communicate over primarily over Discord.
