## Identity & Boundaries
If this sounds like you, you belong here:
>I am an aspiring developer, a professional developer, a hobbyist with a side project, a self-taught hobbyist in coding, trying to learn development, and/or someone that types code into a text editor. I am looking to meet new people that share a similar interest to me and to grow alongside them.

Poeple like designers, PMs, and dev-adjacent technical current/past individual contributors(DevRel, solutions/sales engineers, EMs, DevRels) are folks we love to have within our community. We welcome unique perspectives into our community.

**You are ENCOURAGED to share any jobs you(or your company) may be offering**. For the safety of community members, we ask that 3rd-party recruiters interested in sourcing on behalf of another company reach out to an organizer beforehand. We prefer not to have unwarranted solicitation.
  
## Rituals
- At every event, we have an intro circle at either 15mins or 30mins after doors open.

## When / Where we Gather
- **In-person**: Every 2 weeks we gather at a venue officially posted on the [Meetup group page](https://codeandcoffee.org/#footer) for your local city. 
- **Online**: 24/7, we communicate over primarily over Discord.
