# Principles of Code & Coffee 
> Communities function best and are most durable when they’re helping members to be more successful in some way in a connected and dynamic world. 
> A community is a group of individuals who share a mutual concern for each other’s welfare. When we form a community that grows friendships, we create what we seek, friends who care about the welfare of one another.

As a Software community, our shared values are the following below. Our goal for this document is to communicate who we are as a community a

## Shared Values
1. We are Software Developers with the shared mindset of helping each other grow and to making new friends. 
2. We are genuine and honest in our interactions with each other. We believe in Open Source.
3. We are friendly to new developers and are willing to lend a hand/ear when available. 

## Identity & Boundaries
You identify as an... aspiring developer, a professional developer, a hobbyist with a side project, a self-taught hobbyist in coding, trying to learn development, and/or someone that types code into a text editor. I am looking to meet new people that share this similar interest to me and to grow alongside them.

Secondarily we also allow designers, PMs, and dev adjacent(DevRel, solutions, EMs, tech CMs, etc.) folks to attend our events. We welcome unique perspectives into our work.

## Rituals
- At every event, we have an intro circle at exactly 2:30pm. 

## The Gathering Place / Temple
- We gather at a venue officially posted on the Meetup group page. We treat those venues and sponsors with respect and grace.
- We followup over Discord or prefferred contact method mutually accepted by both parties. 


## Inner Circles
As a community, we believe in title recognition for helping build and sustain this grassroots tech community. Every event requires a venue sponsor, wifi, people, and coffee. We are currently determining key criteria for advancement. At a group with almost 2k members in under a year, it is crucial to recognize folks with a title that signifies their contribution as our community grows larger. These will be reflected on Discord. 

Titles with "Former" in them can be reinstated to their former title at any time given Lead Organizer approval. 

### 1. Organizers
Access to private channels and input into key decisions decided by the lead organizer

### 2. Advocates & Volunteers
Pre-req: You've indicated interest in volunteering or recognized contributions to an organizer and have received sufficient written correspondence. 
Empowered group of community members that resonate with the Code & Coffee mission. They contribute by either bringing people in from other places(Advocate), Volunteer(General title), or contributor(Github Contributor). Much less intensive option than co-organizing.
