# Our Community Principles 
> Communities function best and are most durable when they’re helping members to be more successful in some way in a connected and dynamic world. 

> A community is a group of individuals who share a mutual concern for each other’s welfare. When we form a community that grows friendships, we create what we seek, friends who care about the welfare of one another.
> [The Art of Community: Seven Principles for Belonging](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01E4KC0U4/)

Our goal for this section is to communicate who we are as a community and the boundaries of those we accept in our community. We do this to establish a level of community safety and belonging across all developers, new and old. 
  
[^ Back to Top](https://github.com/nyccodecoffee#table-of-contents)
## Identity & Boundaries
If this sounds like you, you belong here:
>I am an aspiring developer, a professional developer, a hobbyist with a side project, a self-taught hobbyist in coding, trying to learn development, and/or someone that types code into a text editor. I am looking to meet new people that share a similar interest to me and to grow alongside them.

Poeple like designers, PMs, and dev-adjacent technical current/past individual contributors(DevRel, solutions/sales engineers, EMs, DevRels) are folks we love to have within our community. We welcome unique perspectives into our community.

**You are ENCOURAGED to share any jobs you(or your company) may be offering**. For the safety of community members, we ask that 3rd-party recruiters interested in sourcing on behalf of another company reach out to an organizer beforehand, harassment is not tolerated at our events.

## Rituals
- At every event, we have an intro circle at exactly 2:30pm. 

## When / Where we Gather
- **In-person**: Every 2 weeks we gather at a venue officially posted on the Meetup group page. We treat those venues and sponsors with respect and grace.
- **Online**: 24/7, we communicate over Discord or the prefferred contact method mutually accepted by both individual parties.   

## How to Gracefully Exit
Being part of a community sometimes requires comittment through contributor, advocate, organizer, and volunteer roles. Sometimes you just need a break or you've achieved all your individual goals. That's fine and we fully encourage your growth. To leave, indicate your name in the feedback form with a short desc of what you're giving up or a "IM OUT". You will always be re-invited to join anytime at a later date.

## Groups
As a community, we believe in recognition for building and sustaining this grassroots tech community. Every event requires a venue sponsor, wifi, people, and coffee. In a group with almost 2k members in under a year, it is crucial to recognize elders with a title that signifies their contribution to the community. These titles are reflected on Discord.

### 1. Organizers
Access to private channels and input into key decisions decided by the lead organizer. After a certain amount of time of absence(TBD) we will remove organizers from their Discord and meetup titles. This is to ensure safety and clear communication. Former Organizers are highly encouraged to return.
- Lead Organizer
- Organizer

### 2. Volunteers
You've indicated interest in volunteering or have recognized contributions to an organizer and have received sufficient written correspondence.

This is an empowered group of community members that resonate with the Code & Coffee mission. They contribute by either bringing people in from other places(Advocate), Volunteer(General title), or contributor(Github Contributor). Much less intensive than co-organizing while having a significant impact on the steering of community initiatives.
- Advocate
- Contributor
- Volunteer

### 3. Verified Members
The majority of people will be here! We'd love for you to enjoy yourself and your presence is enough contribution :)
- Distinguished Community Member
- Verified Community Member

### 4. New folks
You likely saw this from Meetup.com or referred by an advocate. Welcome!
- Visitor (Start here)

### 5. Outsiders
We do not want these people for the safety of the group and the established values of the community. 
- Outsiders
- Banned

## How to Support
Here's some ways you can support. We're open to volunteers!

### Ongoing tasks (Volunteer)
To figure out what's priority and figure out how to get to your own individual goals with C&C, ask an organizer.

**Open Source Issues**
- Open Source Maintainer - Review code, test it to ensure functionality, and merge it to production.
- Open Source Contributor - Resolve issue tickets with code.
- Operations - Establish process around open source and NYC&C.
- Issue classificationer - tagging the issues with the correct tags and identifying newbie-friendly ones.
- PM - Run the above


**In-person Events**
- Mentor - Help new devs with vague coding topics. Example: be their [rubber duck ]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)) for FreeCodeCamp.com
- Intro Circle Speaker - Run the intro circle and read off a pre-determined script and analyze for feedback
- Lost Puppy finder - Find people looking lost and begin a conversation to ease feelings of belongingness. Bonus points: For being able to connect people with relevant interests together.
- Developer Advocate - See below. We want everyone to do this.
- Content - We need lots of it. Images, tweets, photos, videos, written(add it to our stories!), etc.
- Quality Assurance - Ensure things work as expected and bugs are filed in issues.
- Feedback - Issues and/or improvements. Incidents of people being inflammatory or harassing. Ensure these are bubbled up to organizers.


### Developer Advocacy Program
- We're always looking for Developer Advocates. You informally report to the lead organizer to help achieve determined metrics around community growth, product vision/strategy, and partnership/sponsorships via your own autonomy. Ideally for folks with marketing experience and/or professional software engineers that really like C&C and can bring other software folks!

### Organizing
- Higher committment role. The core group of folks that run these events. These are people that strive to build trust with attendees and understands the impact of being a public figure within the community. 
- Inquire with Steve#2340 on discord or an organizer in-person if interested!

### Donate
We strive to create a resilient community run by it's own members and look to use all funds toward operating this community. We actively look for opportunities with sponsors and potential partnerships to create better events.
