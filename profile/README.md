## How to Contribute
Here's some ways you can support to the mission of NY Code & Coffee. "To make friends and grow together"

### Primary Tasks
- First to arrive
- Intro Circle Leader
- Greeter
- Coffee
- Event Experience Support

**Event Experience team*
- We run a group of dedicated event operations staff to help with live events. In NYC, led by Jonathan Schumann

- Feedback - Issues and/or improvements. Incidents of people being inflammatory or harassing. Ensure these are bubbled up to organizers.

Unique roles
- Intro Circle Speaker - Run the intro circle and read off a pre-determined script and analyze for feedback
- Connectors - Find people looking lost and begin a conversation to ease anxieties.
- Developer Advocate - See below. We want everyone to do this.

### Developer Advocacy Program
- We're always looking for Developer Advocates. You informally report to the lead organizer to help achieve determined metrics around community growth, product vision/strategy, and partnership/sponsorships via your own autonomy. Ideally for folks with marketing experience and/or professional software engineers that really like C&C and can bring other software folks!

### Organizing
- Higher committment role. The core group of folks that run these events. These are people that strive to build trust with attendees and understands the impact of being a public figure within the community. 
- Inquire with Steve#2340 on discord or an organizer in-person if interested!



# Our Community Principles 
> A community is a group of individuals who share a mutual concern for each otherâ€™s welfare. When we form a community that grows friendships, we create what we seek, friends who care about the welfare of one another.
> [The Art of Community: Seven Principles for Belonging](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01E4KC0U4/)

Our goal for this section is to communicate who we are as a community and the boundaries of those we accept in our community. We do this to establish a level of community safety and belonging across all developers, new and old. 
  
## Identity & Boundaries
If this sounds like you, you belong here:
>I am an aspiring developer, a professional developer, a hobbyist with a side project, a self-taught hobbyist in coding, trying to learn development, and/or someone that types code into a text editor. I am looking to meet new people that share a similar interest to me and to grow alongside them.

Poeple like designers, PMs, and dev-adjacent technical current/past individual contributors(DevRel, solutions/sales engineers, EMs, DevRels) are folks we love to have within our community. We welcome unique perspectives into our community.

**You are ENCOURAGED to share any jobs you(or your company) may be offering**. For the safety of community members, we ask that 3rd-party recruiters interested in sourcing on behalf of another company reach out to an organizer beforehand. We prefer not to have unwarranted solicitation.
  
## Rituals
- At every event, we have an intro circle at either 15mins or 30mins after doors open.

## When / Where we Gather
- **In-person**: Every 2 weeks we gather at a venue officially posted on the Meetup group page. We treat those venues and sponsors with respect and grace.
- **Online**: 24/7, we communicate over Discord or the preferred contact method mutually accepted by both individual parties.
