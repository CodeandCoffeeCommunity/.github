# Our Community Principles 
> Communities function best and are most durable when they’re helping members to be more successful in some way in a connected and dynamic world. 
> A community is a group of individuals who share a mutual concern for each other’s welfare. When we form a community that grows friendships, we create what we seek, friends who care about the welfare of one another.
> [The Art of Community: Seven Principles for Belonging](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01E4KC0U4/)

Our goal for this section is to communicate who we are as a community and those boundaries of those we accept in our community. We do this to establish a level of community safety and belonging in the largest city in America.  

## Shared Values
- We are Software Developers with the shared mindset of helping each other grow and to making new friends. 
- We are genuinely open and honest in our interactions with each other. 
- We are friendly to all(new/old) developers and are willing to lend a hand/ear when available. 

## Identity & Boundaries
This sounds like you:
> I'm an aspiring developer, a professional developer, a hobbyist with a side project, a self-taught hobbyist in coding, trying to learn development, and/or someone that types code into a text editor. I am looking to meet new people that share this similar interest to me and to grow alongside them.

Secondarily we also invite designers, PMs, and dev-adjacent technical(DevRel, solutions, EMs, tech CMs, etc.) folks to attend our events. We welcome unique perspectives into our community.

## Rituals
- At every event, we have an intro circle at exactly 2:30pm. 

## The Gathering Place / Temple
- Every 2 weeks we gather, at a venue officially posted on the Meetup group page. We treat those venues and sponsors with respect and grace.
- We communicate over Discord or the prefferred contact method mutually accepted by both individual parties. 


## Inner Circles
As a community, we believe in recognition for helping build and sustain this grassroots tech community. Every event requires a venue sponsor, wifi, people, and coffee. At a group with almost 2k members in under a year, it is crucial to recognize folks with a title that signifies their contribution to the community. These titles are reflected on Discord.

Titles with "Former" in them can be reinstated to their former title given Lead Organizer approval. 

### 1. Organizers
Access to private channels and input into key decisions decided by the lead organizer
- Lead Organizer
- Organizer
- Former co-organizer

### 2. Advocates & Volunteers
You've indicated interest in volunteering or have recognized contributions to an organizer and have received sufficient written correspondence.

This is an empowered group of community members that resonate with the Code & Coffee mission. They contribute by either bringing people in from other places(Advocate), Volunteer(General title), or contributor(Github Contributor). Much less intensive than co-organizing.  
- Advocate
- Volunteer
- Former Advocates & Volunteers

### 3. Verified Members
The majority of people will be here! We'd love for you to enjoy yourself and your presence is contribution enough.
